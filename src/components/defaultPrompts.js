    See the Victorian Sufi Buddha Lite comment policy: comments should be at least two of {true, necessary, kind}.
    
    - Be kind. Failing that, bring evidence.
    - Be charitable. Assume the people you're talking to or about have thought through the issues you're discussing, and try to represent their views in a way they would recognize.
    - When making a claim that isn't outright obvious, you should proactively provide evidence in proportion to how partisan and inflammatory your claim might be.
    - Don't be egregiously obnoxious.
    - Put research, care, and effort into your posts and comments. Quick gotchas, snipes, and jabs are looked down upon here.
    - Culture war topics are forbidden.
